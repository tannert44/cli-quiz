					<h2>My Sister’s Funeral</h2>
						<h3>Gerald Stern, 1925</h3>

					<p>Since there was no mother for the peach tree we did it</p> 
					<p>all alone, which made the two of us closer</p>
					<p>though closeness brought its loneliness, and it would</p>
					<p>have been better I think sometimes to be sterile</p>
					<p>from the start just to avoid the pain</p>
					<p>which in my life this far has lasted seventy</p>
					<p class="favLine">years for I am in love with a skeleton</p>
					<p>on whose small bones a dress hung for a while,</p>
					<p>on whose small skull a bit of curly hair</p>
					<p>was strung, and what is dust I still don’t know</p>
					<p>since there was no mother to turn to then and ask</p>
					<p>what else was she wearing, did she have on shoes,</p>
					<p>and were the two trees from Georgia, and was it</p>
					<p>true somebody said the other peach</p>
					<p>should have died instead of her; and I could</p>
					<p>imagine the nose going first though forty years later</p>
					<p>the trees were still there and not as big as you’d think;</p>
					<p>and it was my cousin Red with the flabby lips</p>
					<p>who said it, he had red eyes, a red monstrosity,</p>
					<p>a flabby body, half the house was filled with</p> 
					<p>male cousins, they were born in rooms a</p>
					<p>short distance from the rats, I can’t remember</p>
					<p>which ones had the accents nor what his</p>
					<p>Hebrew name was, nor his English.</p>

						<h3>Karen Volkman</h3>

					<p class="favLine">Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,</p>
					<p>the earth, blue egg, in its seeping shell</p>
					<p>dispensing damage like a hollow hell</p>
					<p>inchling weeping for a minor sea</p>

					<p>ticking its tidelets, x and y and z.</p>
					<p>The blue beneficence we call and spell</p>
					<p>and call blue heaven, the whiteblue well</p>
					<p>of constant water, deepening a thee,</p>

					<p>a thou and who, touching every what—</p>
					<p>and in the or, a shudder in the cut—</p>
					<p>and that you are, blue mirror, only stare</p>

					<p>bluest blankness, whether in the where,</p>
					<p>sheen that bleeds blue beauty we are taught</p>
					<p>drowns and booms and vowels.  I will not.</p>
